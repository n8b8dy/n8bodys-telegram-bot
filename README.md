# n8bodys-telegram-bot

This is a telegram bot ([n8body's helper](https://t.me/n8bodys_bot?start=botostore)) made by me (@n8b8dy) for educational and experimental purposes. It uses [webhooks](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#setwebhook) to receive incoming updates instead of long polling. To catch all the webhooks' callbacks, the bot also uses [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/). (Btw, tip: you can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to set up your webhook).

Sooo, don't forget to add all the needed variables to .env file and have fun.
